screensaver-tools.py
====================

This small daemon serves two basic functions:
 * Provides a status-bar icon with one-click enabling and disabling of the
   screensaver.
 * Attempts to set an Away message when the screensaver locks the screen and
   reverts to previous status message on unlock.

For a description of (optional) command-line arguments, see --help.
